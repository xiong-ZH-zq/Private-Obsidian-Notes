The 2023 Wimbledon Men's final, where Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic, highlighted the critical influence of momentum in sports. This study addresses the challenge of quantifying momentum in tennis and its impact on match dynamics.

Initially, our team developed dynamic metrics in tennis analytics by analyzing match progression using logistic regression models. Leveraging win probability fluctuations, we defined "momentum" through Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), offering real-time insights. The ARIMA model predicted momentum shifts, aiding tactical foresight.

Then we explored the stochastic nature of player success through simulations, finding deviations from normal distribution in real match sequences. This challenges conventional beliefs about player momentum and match predictability.

We constructed an index system relevant to tennis match flow and trained a Random Forest model, achieving high predictive capability for player scoring. This framework offers insights for players facing unfamiliar opponents and guides in-game strategy based on momentum stages.

Validating our models across tennis and badminton matches revealed effectiveness in tennis but limitations in badminton due to distinct dynamics. Findings emphasize the need for sport-specific model adjustments.

In a memo to coaches, we highlighted the critical role of momentum in matches and emphasized match performance over personal attributes. Our models enable strategic adaptation to momentum shifts, enhancing competitive strategies and advancing sports analytics.
